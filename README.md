## Approach

1. This repository is based on [lightweight architectural deicions records](docs/adr) to document background information on the tools recommended in this project.
See [adr folder](docs/adr) for additional overview over the tools and best practices added.
See [Joel Parker-Henderson's](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) github repository for documentation

2. This repository will be build to be an implementation of those best practices, so see other assets in this folder for usage examples.
