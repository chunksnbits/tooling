# Use stylelint for CSS / SCSS

* Date: 2019-03-16

## Context and Problem Statement

Consistency for CSS selectors and rules can be hard to maintain in a project involving many team-members with varying CSS knowledge and experience.

In order not to rely solely on a manual review process, tooling may be used to support enforcing a defined CSS styleguide during the project lifecycle.

Especially when using a standard CSS styleguide like [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) or [Atomic](https://github.com/nemophrost/atomic-css) or some extension / combination of those, tooling support for enforcing format rules, can be especially helpful for team-members not yet familiar with the notation.

## Considered Options

Tooling support through linting

Existing solutions:
* [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) (e.g., together with [BEM ruleset](https://github.com/simonsmith/stylelint-selector-bem-pattern))
